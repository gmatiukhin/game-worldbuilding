This is a list of qualities magic system of this world should have.
- Logical in the world
- Consistent
- Utilitarian --- useful not only in combat but in everyday life too
- Use some sort of physical resource
- Preferably not use any form of "mana", but "health" is ok
- Be rooted in real world phenomena (e.g. physics, chemistry)
- Rare (in one of two ways), because of either innate difference between people or scarcity of resources
	1. Magic is available _only_ to few people
	2. Very simple forms can be used by general populace, advanced only by a small group
- Can be used in creative ways by combining with itself and/or by clever usage of the environment
- Simple --- small but diverse group of basic actions
